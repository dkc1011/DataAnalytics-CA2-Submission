    "This project investigates the relation between the abstract concept of Genre and the global market performance of a video game. A vast amount of research has been conducted previously exploring the hundreds of different factors pertaining to the success of a video game. The games development industry has become a financial juggernaut since the turn of the millenium, with the U.S industry alone bringing in 43.4 Billion US Dollars in revenue in 2018(Entertainment Software Association | U.S. Economic Growth, 2019). There are vast numbers of developers breaking into the industry every day, and with that, a vast wealth of games to choose from. This means that the ability to quickly predict what games will perform well in such a saturated market would be very useful for developers. Allowing such a prediction to be made based upon Genre alone would give developers a strong starting point when deciding which projects will have resources allocated.\n",

    "\"Consumer Perceptions & Video Game Sales: A Meeting of the Minds\" by John Sacranie takes an overarching look at all of the various determinants of video game sales which includes Genre. \"Vertical Integration, Exclusivity and Game Sales Performance in the U.S. Video Game Industry\" by Gil and Warzynski had a focus on manual regression that was extrmely useful when comparing the results of the findings of this project. Jeffrey Babb and Neil Terry's \"Comparing Video Game Sales by Gaming Platform\" takes a very direct approach such as that taken here, to see if such a complex issue can be reduced at least in part to one central point. \n",
    "    \n",
    "In this project, a multiple regression model was constructed and applied in an attempt to predict future game sales figures. Certain limits of the research possible were reached during the creation of the project. The singular focus of the question at hand and the focus on categorical data lead to anomolies in the final results, however the findings cannot be discounted. \n",

    "- \"COMPARING VIDEO GAME SALES BY GAMING PLATFORM\" by Jeffrey Babb and Neil Terry. This paper includes a similar research question to the one employed by this paper with an adjustment of subject matter. Babb and Terry's research lead them to suggest, as a 'future extension' to their work, a \"multiple regression model controlling for platform, genre, ESRB rating, publisher, critical reviews, and other potential determinants.\" (Babb and Terry, n.d., p.17). Further research into the authors and their works revealed that no such extension was ever produced. This may have been because the two authors were skeptical about the use of regression for their purpose, citing that they were exploring too many factors for a regressive approach to be immediately viable. (Babb and Terry, n.d., p.13)\n",
    "- \"Consumer Perceptions & Video Game Sales: A Meeting of the Minds\" by John Sacranie did not have the objective of producing predictions for industry purpose, rather his use of statistics, regression and data was focused towards examining the perceptions of the video game consumer (as the title states). His methods were very useful for the purpose of this paper however. Sacranie used regression extensively throughout his paper, including several factors such as console exclusivity, platform, sequel status and others as well as just genre. He also only used 5 genres for his methods as opposed to the 12 utilized for the purposes of this project (Sacranie and Leekley, n.d., p.15). It must be said, that there are far more genres than even 12, but to qualify each and every one is purely subjective. The twelve provided in the data set utilized for this project are objectively recognized by greater games media.\n",
    "- \"Vertical Integration, Exclusivity and Game Sales Performance in the U.S. Video Game Industry\" by Gil and Warzynski focuses exclusively, as the title would suggest, on the United States market. Their paper also features a large focus on the mathematics they utilized to implement their regression formulae. They opted for manual regression, with several equations(Gil and Warzynski, 2009, p.15). There was little of immediate value when auditing this work for the purposes of this project, however some of their extensive results could be used for comparison when considering the viability of predicting game sales based on Genre alone."

    "The methods utilized when producing this method stems chiefly from the research conducted in the background section of this report. All three of the texts mentioned and named, both in the background section and the bibliography below, all utilized or recommended utilizing linear regression in research such as this. Despite that research being key, it was a natural progression for a report with a goal such as this. Processes such as simple association or KDD / Clustering would not be suitable for this topic as the goal is to predict future sales rather than to compare existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implimentation of this Regression model started with the vital encoding of the categorical genre data stored in the dataset. The encoding was done with the pandas.get_dummies function. This function created additional columns for each value in the Genres column containing \"dummy\" values. These values are simple binary indicating if the aligned record is or is not of the represented genre. The encoding of the categorical data allows for it's use in the regression forumlae as strings are not permissable. Several un-needed columns were dropped in the process of cleaning the data, such as the ranking, year, platform and publisher columns. The columns representing the various regions making up the 'Global_Sales' figure were left un-dropped. This was done as a simple column name substitution would need to be made in the model itself to further narrow down the results to represent regions instead of the global market.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regression model itself is applied by utilizing the statsmodels.formula.api library for python, particularly the OLS library (Ordinary least squares) which estimates unknown parameters in the linear regression model. The testing and training data was composed from the sklearn.model_selection library's train_test_split which was used to divide the testing data and the training data fairly."

    "The goal of this report was to qualify the possibility that one could conclude an approximate prediction of a video game's potential sales based solely upon that game's genre. The conclusion I have come to is that genre alone is not sufficient for such a purpose. This analysis is drawn from the model created above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results presented were different from initial expectations. They were surprisingly binary in nature, that is every prediction for every game in the testing data set was given the same projected sales number for it's corresponding genre. Initially I believed this was due to over-fitting, however upon a closer analysis it only made sense that the calculations, drawing from the regression of one contiguous sales format, would come to the same prediction for each new entry into that bracket.\n",
    "\n",
    "When compared with the results from the texts presented in the literature review, particularly in (Sacranie and Leekley, n.d., p.19), the results of the above model showed a much lower Adjusted R2 value (0.05 above to 0.122 in Sacranie's work) as well as a much more carefully adjusted F-Statistic for each category. This indicates a poor selection of variables on which the prediction can act and thus explains the poor quality of the given results.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Solutions\n",
    "- A broader research question: Encapsulating year or developer as well to broaden the selection of variables the regression formula has to work on.\n",
    "- Diversifying genres to allow a game to have more than one genre: Expanding the selection of variables. Allowing a game to be both shooter AND simulation as we see in many military simulation games today, or platforming AND adventure which is a popular combination in the industry, could result in more substantial and individual results.\n",
    "- Improved implementation : The model above produced unusual and insubstantial results, but the few results given did correlate with my own expectations for the given genres based upon personal domain knowledge and the sales bar chart given above. This leads me to believe that improvements to the implementation of the model could see regression as a good fit for this category of data analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The discovery techniques could be considered successful as they lead me to several conclusions and a proper understanding of why the ultimate, overall application of the modelling failed. In a business context, this system may be useful very one dimensionally, as it would succesfully predict based on genre one singular release based upon each genre.\n"

    "In summation, it is extremely challenging yet not impossible to dictate the potential success of a video game based upon Genre alone. Further research into the possibility could be performed with methods other than Regression, or by utilizing one of the aforementioned solutions from the discussion section. Further improvements could be made on the model by allowing a narrower field for independent regions, such as North America or Europe, instead of exclusively relying on the Global sales statistic."
